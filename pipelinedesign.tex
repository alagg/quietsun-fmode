\subsection{Data movement and analysis pipeline}
\added{should we have here a simple diagram to explain our data movement and analysis pipeline that later on you can refer to, e.g., funcx, MPS server, ... move data from where to where, trigger the analysis}

\added{and then in the discussion, we can have a paragraph to discuss the IT/pipeline roles for the community, if needed}
